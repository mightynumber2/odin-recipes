    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>White bread or biscuits</li>
      <li>2 tbs of real animal (no margarine!) butter (optional)</li>
      <li>1 lb ground beefus</li>
      <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flower power</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cup of whole milk - skim is sugary crud</li>
      <li>Some salt</li>
      <li>Some peppa, if you prefer, if not - it's okay</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring out your <strong>white</strong> bread or biscuits.</li>
      <li>Butter them, <em>tbs each</em>, if you will.</li>
      <li>
        Get that All-American ground beef sizzling on the stove, medium-high for
        that sear effect.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove ground beef from pan when there's only a few light-pink areas
        left.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in flour and milk in the same pan, mixing into the hot beef fat.
        Some say do it slowly, I say: Just Do It.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lower heat and stir the mixture until your wrist is unhappy and it
        becomes creamy or gooey. Preference.
      </li>
      <li>
        Get the ground beef back in there. Mix. Smell it. Dip your finger and
        taste; then salt and pepper to taste. Then taste again. Remove from pan
        into a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Toast your buttered buns of choice in the air fryer. Don't have an air
        fryer? Then flip them butterside down onto the greasy pan you just used
        until they are toasted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slap toasted buns-of-choice onto a plate and top with creamy beef.
      </li>
      <li>You're welcome.</li>
    </ol>
