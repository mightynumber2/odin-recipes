    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Easiest chicken wings you'll ever make. Ketchup. It's all you need in
      life, let's be honest. Okay?
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Are you serious?</em> You damn skippy I'm serious. Never been more
      serious. This ain't some joke. This is the way.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Bag of frozen wings from Walmart. Don't bother cutting up fresh ones
        from the meat section. Too much work, not enough reward.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ketchup. I'm talking the corn syrup kind. REAL ketchup. None of that
        "real sugar" stuff. That stuff is <strong>weaksauce</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>That's it. Don't laugh. I mean it.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook the wings until crispy in either the air fryer or oven. No flipping
        needed. Trust me.
      </li>
      <li>Remove from cooking source and add to a white plate.</li>
      <li>Drizzle in corn syrupy ketchup.</li>
      <li>Live your best life.</li>
    </ol>
